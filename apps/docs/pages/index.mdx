# Prepaid Gas SDK

Privacy-preserving gas payments using Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) and zero-knowledge proofs via the Semaphore protocol.

## What is Prepaid Gas?

The Prepaid Gas SDK enables users to pay for gas fees anonymously by joining privacy pools. Using zero-knowledge proofs, users can prove membership in a pool without revealing their identity, enabling truly private transactions on Ethereum and compatible networks.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure transaction privacy
- **Account Abstraction**: Built on ERC-4337 standard for seamless UX  
- **Pool-Based System**: Join pools to share gas costs anonymously
- **Multi-Network**: Support for Base, Optimism, and other EVM chains
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types

## Architecture Overview

The SDK consists of two main packages:

### [@prepaid-gas/core](/core/)
The primary SDK for paymaster integration:
- `PrepaidGasPaymaster` client for ZK proof generation
- Two-phase operations (estimation + validation)
- Context encoding and paymaster data formatting

### [@prepaid-gas/data](/data/)  
Data layer with fluent query builders:
- `SubgraphClient` for pool and transaction data
- Network-aware multi-chain querying
- Type-safe GraphQL query construction

## Privacy Model

**Pool-Based Anonymity**: Users join pools by adding identity commitments to Merkle trees. Gas payments prove pool membership without revealing which specific member is transacting.

**Cross-Pool Privacy**: Transactions within the same pool are linkable via nullifiers, but using different identities across pools provides unlinkability.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Built on Semaphore protocol for computational soundness and privacy guarantees.

## Quick Start

Get started with the Prepaid Gas SDK in minutes:

```bash
npm install @prepaid-gas/core @prepaid-gas/data
```

```typescript
import { PrepaidGasPaymaster } from '@prepaid-gas/core'

// Create paymaster client for Base Sepolia
const paymaster = PrepaidGasPaymaster.createForNetwork(84532)

// Generate paymaster data for transaction
const result = await paymaster.getPaymasterData({
  userOp,
  poolId: '1',
  identity: 'your-identity-base64'
})
```
