# PrepaidGas

Enable users to pay for their own gas using zero-knowledge proofs across dApps.

## What is PrepaidGas?

PrepaidGas is a **privacy-first gas payment system** that lets users buy their own gas credits and use them across any supporting dApp. Think of it like buying a prepaid phone card, but for blockchain gas fees.

**For Users:** Buy gas credits once, use them across all supporting dApps without revealing your identity to the paymaster
**For Developers:** Users pay for their own transactions - zero gas costs for you

## How It Works

### The User Journey
1. **Buy Gas Credits** - Visit [testnet.prepaidgas.xyz](https://testnet.prepaidgas.xyz) to purchase prepaid gas
2. **Get Payment Context** - Receive an encoded string after purchase  
3. **Configure in Any dApp** - Paste the context into any supporting dApp's settings
4. **Use ZK Proofs** - Transactions prove you have credits without revealing which specific credits you purchased

### The Developer Experience  
1. **Add Paymaster Settings** - Let users configure their own gas credits
2. **Integrate SDK** - Handle user paymaster contexts with `@prepaid-gas/core`
3. **Zero Gas Costs** - Users pay for their own transactions automatically
4. **Enhanced Privacy** - Attract users who value unlinkable gas payments
