# Smart Contracts

PrepaidGas uses three paymaster contracts with different gas consumption models. All share the same core foundation.

## Available Paymasters

- **[OneTimeUse](/contracts/one-time-use)** - Single-use gas credits 
- **[GasLimited](/contracts/gas-limited)** - Multi-use credits with spending limits
- **[CacheEnabled](/contracts/cache-enabled)** - Optimized multi-use with caching

## Shared Foundation

All paymasters inherit from the same base contracts that provide common functionality:

### BasePaymaster
ERC-4337 paymaster interface implementation:
- Validation and post-operation handling
- EntryPoint integration and stake management

### PrepaidGasPool  
Zero-knowledge pool management:
- Semaphore ZK proof verification
- Merkle tree state management for privacy pools
- Member deposits and joining logic

## Common ZK Proof Structure

All paymasters use the same Semaphore proof format:

```solidity
struct PoolMembershipProof {
    uint256 merkleTreeDepth;
    uint256 merkleTreeRoot;
    uint256 nullifier;
    uint256 message;
    uint256 scope;
    uint256[8] points;
}
```

## Shared Configuration

- **Joining Amount**: Configurable deposit amount (e.g., 0.0001 ETH)
- **Scope Binding**: Proofs bound to specific paymaster + chain + amount

## Network Deployments

**Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)**
- OneTimeUse: `0x4DACA5b0a5d10853F84bB400C5232E4605bc14A0`
- GasLimited: `0xDEc68496A556CeE996894ac2FDc9E43F39938e62`
- CacheEnabled: `0xfFE794611e59A987D8f13585248414d40a02Bb58`

## Privacy Model

**Pool-Based System**: Users join by depositing and adding identity commitments

**Unlinkable Purchases**: Transactions prove membership without revealing which user made the original purchase

**Nullifier Linkability**: For GasLimited and CacheEnabled, transactions using the same gas credits are linkable to each other via nullifiers
